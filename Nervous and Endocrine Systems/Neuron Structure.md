Parts of a Neuron

Dendrite: cellular extension that collects nerve impulses from many other neurons and passes them to the cell body.

Cell body: contains the nucleus and other organelles.

Axon: carries the nerve impulse long distances from the cell body towards an axon terminal. An axon terminal leads to another neuronâ€™s dendrites across a gap called a synapse.

Axon terminal: found at the end of the axon. Each terminal has a synaptic knob on it that secretes a neurotransmitter into the synapse.

Synapse: the space between two neurons

Neurilemma: a membrane that is present on some neurons that allows them to regenerate if injured.

Myelin sheath: motor neurons have white, fatty, insulating Schwann cells wrapped around the axon. The tiny regions of exposed axon between the
Schwann cells are called nodes of Ranvier. Collectively, all the Schwann cells together form a myelin sheath. When a nerve impulse travels along a
myelinated axon, the impulse jumps from node to node increasing the speed of conduction of the nerve impulse. Nerves that are bright white are
myelinated. Nervous tissue that is grey (the cortex of the brain) is not myelinated.
